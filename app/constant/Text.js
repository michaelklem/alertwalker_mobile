Aspire does not grant you any title or other intellectual property rights in the Software. You may not sell, redistribute, or reproduce the Software, nor may you decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or otherwise convert any part of the Software to a human-perceivable form.\n\nAccess to Third-Party Accounts\nAs part of the functionality of the Application, You may link your account with online accounts You have with third-party service providers (as examples, Facebook, Etsy, Instagram, Google, Outlook, Apple, or other supported email providers) (each a “Third-Party Account”) by either: (1) providing your Third-Party Account login information through the Application; or (2) otherwise allowing the Application to access your Third-Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent and warrant that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to us and/or grant us access to your Third-Party Account, without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account, and without obligating us to pay any fees or making us subject to any usage limitations imposed by the third-party service provider of the Third-Party Account. By granting us access to any Third-Party\n\nAccounts, you understand that (1) the Application may access and make available to you any content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account or that is otherwise accessible from the Third-Party Account (the “Social Network Content”) so that it is visible in the Application, and (2) we may submit to and receive from your Third-Party Account additional information authorized when you link your account with the Third-Party Account.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.

You can deactivate the connection between the Application and your Third-Party Account by contacting us using the contact information below or through your account settings (if applicable). We will attempt to delete any information stored on our servers that was obtained through such Third-Party Account, except for items such as a username or profile picture that become associated with your Aspire account.\n\nInfringement Claims – Digital Millennium Copyright Act\nAspire takes copyright infringement seriously. Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (Title 17 USC 512(c)), a copyright owner or their agent may submit a takedown notice to Aspire. As a service provider, Aspire is entitled to claim immunity from infringement claims pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the DMCA.\n\nAspire makes a good faith effort to identify any repeat infringers. Those that violate Aspire’s internal repeat infringer policy will have their accounts terminated.\n\nInfringement Claims\nTo submit an infringement claim to Aspire, you must provide a notice including the following information:\n\n· Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n\n· Identification of the infringing material to be removed, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Aspire to locate the material. Please submit the Username and a description of the infringing material and where it is stored.\n\n· Contact information including your name, physical address, email address, and phone number.\n\n· A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that the use of the material is unauthorized.\n\n· A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n\n· A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner (or authorized representative).\n\nCivil damage penalties, including costs and attorney fees, may apply against any person who knowingly and materially misrepresents certain information in a notification of infringement. Send all takedown notices to support@aspireproductivityapp.com.\n\nPlease note that the identity and information in any copyright infringement claim we receive may be communicated to the alleged infringer.\n\nDisputing a Take Down\nIf you have received a notice that your Content was taken down because of a copyright infringement claim, you may provide us with a counter notification in an effort to have the material in question restored to the Service(s). The notification must be sent in writing to support@aspireproductivityapp.com and must contain the following elements (17 USC 512(g)(3)):\n\n· A description of the material that has been taken down and the original location of the material before it was taken down.\n\n· A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled because of mistake or misidentification of the material.\n\n· Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial district in which the address is located (or if you are outside of the United States, that you consent to jurisdiction of any judicial district in which the service provider may be found), and that the you will accept service of process from the person or company who provided the original infringement notification.\n\n· Your physical or electronic signature.\n\nDisclaimers and Limitations of Liability\nAspire endeavors to provide reliable access to Content you create or store via the Application. However, the Services are subject to various modes of failure and loss of data, some of which are beyond Aspire’s control. Further, because your Third-Party Account user information and passwords, and the Content you create, store, and retrieve using the Application, are all transmitted over publicly accessible networks (such as mobile data communications networks and the internet) as well as being stored on servers connected to these networks, there is an inherent risk that your Content will be intercepted or improperly accessed by third party actors.\n\nYour use of the Service(s) is at your own risk, and on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis. To the full extent permitted by law, Aspire hereby excludes all express and implied warranties, including (without limitation) implied warranties of non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose.\n\nIn addition, to the extent permitted by law, Aspire (and its officers, directors, agents, service providers, and employees) shall not be liable for any damages or losses resulting in any way from:\n\n· Content you provide while using the Service(s).\n\n· Your use of or inability to use Service(s).\n\n· Loss of Content and/or loss of access to Content created using the Services.\n\n· Your failure to secure your device(s) and your account information.\n\n· Interception of data or other unauthorized access to data by a third party.\n\n· Any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service(s).\n\n· Viruses or other malicious software, glitches, bugs, errors or inaccuracies resulting from access to the Service(s).\n\n· Damage to your device(s) while using the Service(s).\n\n· The behavior, actions and inactions of third parties using the Service(s).\n\n· Actions taken by Aspire in response to violations of the Terms of Service and its other policies, as amended from time to time.\n\n· Any effects of changes in Aspire operations, policies and Terms of Service on You or any business you conduct, including without limitation the need to modify your Content and practices to comply with such changes.\n\n· The technical operating and transmission features of the Service(s), including without limitation the transfer of unencrypted Content over various networks.\n\n· Acts (or failures to act) of Aspire’s third party hardware, software, and network service providers.\n\nThe foregoing exclusions of Aspire liability apply to all forms of damages or losses, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary, and including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, personal injury, or intangible losses (even if Aspire has been advised of the possibility of such damages).\n\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.\n\nIf despite the provisions herein, Aspire is found to be liable for damages to you or another party, our liability is limited to the greater of (i) the amount you paid for the Services within the six months preceding the event causing the claimed liability, and (ii) $100.\n\nRelease and Indemnity\nYou release Aspire and its officers, directors, employees and agents from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every type, known and unknown, connected in any way with your use of the Aspire Services. You expressly waive any statutory or other protection\n\nthat would otherwise limit this release to claims that you know of (or suspect to exist) when you open your account and agree to this release.\n\nYou will indemnify and hold harmless Aspire, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claim or demand (and reasonable attorney’s fees) made by any third party arising out of your breach of these Terms of Service, your improper use of the Service(s), your failure to honor the terms of a transaction arranged using the Service(s), or your violation of any law or other rights of a third party.\n\nArbitration of Disputes with Aspire\nAny claim or dispute arising between you and Aspire that relates in any way to the Aspire Terms of Service, your use of or access to the Service(s), actions by Aspire or its agents, or any transaction through the Service(s), will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court.\n\nAs an alternative, you may file a claim in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.\n\nProhibition of Class and Representative Actions\nYOU AND ASPIRE MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE STATUS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS OR PRESIDE OVER ANY CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF FOR THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS.\n\nArbitration Procedure\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org.\n\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought. The Notice to Aspire should be sent to Aspire99 LLC, Attn: Notice of Dispute, 1010 ECS Way, Belvidere, IL 61008. Aspire will send any Notice to the email or SMS address on file for your Aspire account; it is your responsibility to keep your email and SMS addresses up to date.\n\nIf you and Aspire are unable to resolve the claims in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, either party may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of\n\nthe completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to Aspire at the following address: 1010 ECS Way, Belvidere, IL 61008. If Aspire initiates an arbitration it will send a copy of the completed form to the email or SMS address on file for your Aspire account. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. Settlement offers shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.\n\nThe arbitration hearing shall be held in Belvidere, Illinois. If the value of the relief sought is $1,000 or less, either you or Aspire may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based on written submissions.\n\nThe arbitrator will decide all claims consistent with applicable law and will honor privileges recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving other users. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding; judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n\nOpt-Out Procedure\nYOU CAN REJECT THE ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT HEREIN BY MAILING Aspire A WRITTEN NOTICE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU OPEN YOUR ACCOUNT FOR THE FIRST TIME.\n\nThe Notice must include your name, street address, city, state and zip code, and the user ID(s) and email address(es) associated with the Aspire account(s) to which the opt-out applies, and must be signed by you. You must mail the Opt-Out notice to Aspire99 LLC, Attn: Legal Notice, 1010 ECS Way, Belvidere, IL 61008. This is the only way to opt out of arbitration; the rest of the Terms of Service will continue to apply. Opting out of arbitration as provided in this version of the Terms of Service has no effect on any other or future arbitration agreements you may have with Aspire.\n\nGeneral Terms\nIf the arbitration provisions above are found not to apply to your claim, the state courts located in Illinois and the Federal courts located in Illinois will have exclusive jurisdiction, and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.\n\nThis Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy, and all policies posted through the Service(s) constitute the entire agreement between you and Aspire and supersede any prior agreements between you and Aspire (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). The failure of Aspire to exercise or enforce any of its rights shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. The laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern the Terms of Service and any claim or dispute between you and Aspire. Headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of any section. If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck out and the remaining provisions will remain in force. The provisions of these Terms of Service which by their nature are intended to survive termination will survive its termination.\n\nPrivacy policy\n\nI.
